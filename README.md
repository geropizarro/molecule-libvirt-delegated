An implementation of Molecule's delegated driver to leverage an existing libvirt daemon. It's meant to be used with preconfigured  custom images or [generic cloud images such as these](https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/obtain-images.html).

It is necessary to install the included **delegated.py** script since the delegated driver does not currently support the ansible_become variables required for testing scenarios where escalation is needed. [PR was submitted and approved](https://github.com/ansible/molecule/pull/1738) though not yet merged.


Assumptions
-----------

- Functioning libvirt daemon on the default qemu:///system uri.
- The libguestfs-tools package providing virt-customize is installed.
- Appropriate permissions for the user running Molecule on the libvirt daemon, directories, etc.


Common Variables
-----------------

These can be set at the driver and platform levels. At the driver level they apply to every platform, unless set also at the platform level, which takes precendence.
